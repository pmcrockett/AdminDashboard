Page layout for an admin dashboard coded in HTML/CSS/JavaScript featuring extensive use of CSS Grid. Page contents flow with browser size, and extreme font sizes don't break the layout.

Font size and light/dark mode can be changed with the buttons in the upper right; all other buttons and links are inactive.
